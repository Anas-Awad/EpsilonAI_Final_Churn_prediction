## project Description 
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row
in the data provides relavant information about the patient.
- using statistical methods to analyse and extracting information from the dataset like (features distributions, centeral tendancy, measure of despersion and many boxplots and many other statistical techniques finishing with classical machine learning classification models and deploy it to web app for graphical using.
- tools that i have used are (Pandas, Numpy, seaborn, sklearn, category_encoders, streamlit, joblib, imblearn )


## files Description
- (h5) --> extension files is about the saved models and instances and also features_names that the model had trained on (located in models-deployement folder).
- (csv) --> datasets existed in both folders each data for its phase
